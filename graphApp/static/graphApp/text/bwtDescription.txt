The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a data transformation algorithm that rearranges the characters of a string into runs of similar characters, which can improve compression efficiency. The BWT works by generating all possible rotations of a string, sorting them lexicographically, and then extracting the last column of the sorted rotations. This transformed string, known as the BWT output, often exhibits long runs of repeated characters, making it more amenable to subsequent compression techniques like Run-Length Encoding or Huffman Coding. Originally devised for data compression, the BWT is a key component in several modern data compression algorithms, including bzip2.
