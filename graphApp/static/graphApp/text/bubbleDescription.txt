Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no further swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Each pass through the list "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to its correct position, which is why the algorithm is named "bubble sort." Though easy to understand and implement, Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its average and worst-case time complexity of O(𝑛^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.
