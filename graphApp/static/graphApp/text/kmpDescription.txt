The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string searching method used to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text. It preprocesses the pattern to create a partial match table that helps avoid redundant comparisons, allowing it to search the text in linear time relative to the combined length of the text and the pattern. The KMP algorithm returns the starting indices of each occurrence of the pattern in the text.
