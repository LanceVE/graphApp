The Fisher-Yates shuffle is an algorithm used to randomly permute the elements of an array or list. It works by iterating through the array from the last element to the first. For each element at index i, it swaps it with a randomly chosen element from the range between the start of the array and index i (inclusive). This process ensures that each permutation of the array is equally likely, providing an unbiased shuffle. The algorithm runs in linear time, making it efficient for generating random permutations.
