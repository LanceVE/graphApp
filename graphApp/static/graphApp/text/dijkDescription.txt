Dijkstra’s algorithm is a fundamental method used in computer science and graph theory to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. Developed by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, this algorithm efficiently computes the minimum distance from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It operates by iteratively selecting the closest unvisited node, updating the distances to its neighboring nodes, and repeating this process until all nodes have been visited. Dijkstra’s algorithm is widely used in network routing, mapping, and various optimization problems.
