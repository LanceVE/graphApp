Function BWT(input_string):
1   Append '$' to input_string
2   Let n be the length of input_string
3   Initialize an empty list for rotations
4   For i from 0 to n-1:
5        Create a rotation by taking the substring from index i to end, concatenated with the substring from start to index i
6        Add this rotation to the list of rotations
7   Sort the list of rotations lexicographically
8   Initialize an empty string for bwt_transform
9   For each rotation in sorted rotations:
10        Append the last character of the rotation to bwt_transform
11  Return bwt_transform
