Merge sort is a highly efficient, stable sorting algorithm that follows a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements. It works by recursively dividing an unsorted list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains a single element. These sublists are then merged back together in a sorted manner, ensuring that the final result is a fully sorted list. Merge sort is known for its consistent O(n log n) time complexity, making it ideal for sorting large datasets. It also maintains the relative order of equal elements, which is beneficial when stability is a requirement. Despite its efficiency, merge sort does require additional space proportional to the size of the input, as it needs extra space for merging the sublists.
